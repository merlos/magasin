The [`install-magasin.sh`](https://github.com/unicef/magasin/blob/main/installer/install-magasin.sh) is a shell script that installs all the dependencies required to setup up all the helm charts that compose magasin. 

You can find more details on what it does in the [advanced installation page](../install/advanced.qmd).

It has a companion that is the [`uninstall-script.sh`](https://github.com/unicef/magasin/blob/main/installer/uninstall-magasin.sh)

The installer and uninstaller source code can be found under the [installer/](https://github.com/unicef/magasin/blob/main/installer/) folder within the main magasin repository.

## Installer tests

The installer includes various functionality and options; in order to verify these are working we have created a CI/CD pipeline using Github actions that runs several tests in different operating systems. 

To view the source code visit [`install-tests.yaml`](https://github.com/unicef/magasin/blob/main/.github/workflows/install-tests.yml)
