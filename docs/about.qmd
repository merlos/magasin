## About Magasin

Magasin (pronounced /ma.ɡa.zɛ̃/) is an end-to-end suite of open-source tools stitched together to provide production grade automated ingestion, transformation, and storage as well as the enabling infrastructure and tools to perform data analysis, visualization of datasets and ML / AI.

You can learn more about [why we created magasin](why-magasin.qmd) and its [architecture](architecture.qmd).

## Brief history 

Magasin grew out of Office of Innovation's and Information and Communication Technology Division (ICTD) work to establish a [RapidPro](https://www.rapidpro.io) Data Warehouse to enable aggregation of global metrics across vendor instances.

Also informed by experiences of the [Magic Box](https://www.unicef.org/innovation/Magicbox) applied data science initiative, a range of components were evaluated and trialed with country offices to arrive at the current components and architecture.

In 2021, ICTD engaged one of its long term agreement vendors to assist with evolving the proof-of-concept into a minimum viable product (MVP).

In 2023, UNICEF ICTD Digital Center of Excellence (DCOE) started the journey to detach _magasin_ from its organizational and cloud infrastructure dependencies, and release it as an open-source platform with the goal of becoming a [Digital Public Good](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/digital-public-goods/).

On [February 2nd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog_Day_(film)),2024, UNICEF released magasin as an [open source](https://github.com/unicef/magasin) solution. In this release, an [easy to install process](install/) toolkit wask included, as well as [how to get started documentation](get-started/).
