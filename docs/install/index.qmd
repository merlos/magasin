Magasin is a scalable end-to-end data platform based on open-source components that are natively run in a [kubernetes cluster](https://kubernetes.io).

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) is a container orchestration system designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of [containerized applications](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/#going-back-in-time). It is an integral part of services offered by major cloud providers. Kubernetes, being open source, can also be set up on-premises. For testing purposes, it is even possible to install it on a desktop computer.

Magasin uses Kubernetes in combination with [Helm](https://helm.sh/), a package manager for Kubernetes applications. Helm is the equivalent to apt, pip, npm, pacman, snap, conda. Using Helm, users specify the configuration of required Kubernetes resources to deploy magasin through a values file or command-line overrides. A package in helm is called **chart**.

Magasin includes an installer script that sets up all the necessary dependencies on your computer, enabling the seamless setup of the magasin within the Kubernetes cluster.


##  Deploy magasin using the installer (beta)

Once you have access to a Kubernetes cluster, you can use the installer to setup magasin in that cluster. 

The major goal of this installer is to ease the setup of some tools that need to be installed on your computer, and then deploy magasin to the kubernetes cluster.

:::{.callout-warning}
It is highly recommended to [take a look at the install script](https://unicef.github.io/magasin/install-magasin.sh) before running it as it will install several components on your system.

You should run curl-bashing (curl piped with bash/zsh) only on providers that you trust. If you're not confortable with this approach, proceed with the [manual installation](manual-installation.qmd).
:::

* **Deploying magasin using a Debian/Like GNU/Linux computer**

    ```bash
    curl -sSL https://unicef.github.io/magasin/install-magasin.sh | bash
    ```

  Debian like distributions are Ubuntu, Raspbian, Kali Linux, etc. They use `apt-get` as package manager.  

* **Deploying magasin using a Mac OS computer**

  ```bash
  curl -sSL https://unicef.github.io/magasin/install-magasin.sh | zsh
  ```

In both cases, you need a user that can run sudo.

The installer is in beta, in case it fails check the [troubleshooting section](troubleshooting.qmd) and, if the problems persist, try the [manual installation](manual-installation.qmd)


* **Deploying magasin on a Windows computer**
  Please use the [manual installation](manual-installation.qmd)
