Implementing an end-to-end cloud-native data solution like magasin effectively requires not just setting up the technology, which is a mere enabler, but also implementing adjustments in people and processes. Without these it is harder to enhance the organization’s ability to make data-informed decisions.

Here are some considerations to ensure your organization successfully deploys magasin. While **not every consideration needs to be fully implemented from the start**, they will become more effective as your organization becomes more adept at utilizing data. 

When dealing with technology for development (ICT4D) system strengthening initiatives giving some thoughts on these considerations will help to a more successful deployment.

## The team (People dimension)

From a personnel standpoint, an organisation must ensure that it has, or will acquire or recruit, the appropriate skills not only for implementing and maintaining the tool but also for processing and extracting insights from the data. Below are the common roles along with the technical skills and capabilities that an organisation should assess to operationalise magasin:

### **System administrator** 
Establishes and manages a magasin instance. While magasin can be operated on a laptop, for a production environment that serves various teams across an organisation, centralised management is more effective. The skills and capabilities required for this role include:

     - Daskhub (Configuration/system operations level)
     - MinIO (Configuration/system operations level)
     - Mag-cli (User level)

### Data Analyst / Scientist
Needs to understand the business itself and collaborate very closely with the businesspeople, based on these conversations so he can “ask” research questions to the existing data, or research on what datasets may be able to answer these questions. This profile identifies data sources (internal and external) and performs explorations to analyze the data to extract insights, generally through visualizations and tracking indicators. Also, during the automation process he works with the data engineer to automate the process of getting real time insights.

* Data Analysis and Exploration (Core):
    - Data analysis techniques and methodologies.
     - Experience with data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.
     - Ability to explore and analyze both internal and external datasets.

     - Knowledge of statistical methods and their application in data analysis.
     - Ability to perform hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and other statistical techniques.
*	Data Visualization (Core):
     - Expertise in creating visualizations to communicate insights effectively.
     - Experience with tools like Jupyter Notebooks and self-service BI tools (e.g., Superset, PowerBI, Tableau).
*	Domain Knowledge (Recommended):
     - Familiarity with the industry and business context to derive meaningful insights.
     - Ability to translate business requirements into data-driven solutions.
* Machine Learning (Recommended):
     - Understanding of machine learning algorithms and their applications.
     - Experience with libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch as well as large language models.

## Processes dimension

Another aspect of implementing magasin is related with the processes that will be needed to be setup by the organization:

1. **Data Quality Management**
   The effectiveness of data-informed decision-making largely depends on the quality of the data used. This fundamental principle implies that without high-quality data, any investment in a data platform is futile. Often encapsulated by the phrase "garbage in, garbage out," it means that poor input data results in flawed insights and decisions.

   As your organization manages more datasets, ensuring data quality is crucial throughout the entire data lifecycle, beginning prior to ingestion processes, and emphasizing aspects such as accuracy, reliability, consistency, completeness, implement data cleansing to remove duplicates, correct errors, and update outdated information…

2. **Data governance**
     Implementing a solid data governance process involves determining who can access, share, and delete data. When you define this you have to lever to maximize data utility and to be concious of personal data privacy as well as to minimize the potential data breaches.  Data governance is especially critical when handing sensitive/confidential and personal data. Also, you may need to define a data governance to comply with local and international regulations (f.i. GDPR).

3. **Data documentation and metadata management** 
     Maintain comprehensive documentation and metadata management to track data lineage and support data stewardship.
 
4. **Implement master data management**
     Centralize and standardize key data entities to ensure consistency and accuracy across the organizational data. Elements such as office identifiers, employees’ identifiers, product names, supplier codes, department/division names and unique identifiers, country names and identifiers, etc.

5. **Data lifecycle management** 
     Establishing rules and processes for not only in terms of capturing data, but also archival and deletion.
